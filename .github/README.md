Welcome to my system configuration files! Ironically, nothing here is actually under my `$HOME` directory. My system is managed by Nix, as I use NixOS. Well, most of it is. My AwesomeWM configuration and Neovim configuration files are still written in lua, as the number of edits, features, and customizations I have done on them are too massive for me to convert those configs to Nix. The only configuration left to convert to Nix is **wezterm**.

**Note**: Please don't use this as a template NixOS setup - I just started using NixOS and I'm sure what I'm doing isn't the best at some places.


## Setup for NixOS
1. Get the latest [NixOS ISO](https://nixos.org/download.html) and boot into the installer/environment.
2. Format and mount your disks.
3. Follow these commands:

```bash
# Get into a Nix shell with git and flakes
nix-shell -p git nixFlakes

# Clone my dotfiles
git clone https://github.com/JavaCafe01/awedots /mnt/etc/nixos

# Remove this file
rm /mnt/etc/nixos/thonkpad/hardware-configuration.nix

# Generate a config and copy the hardware configuration, disregarding the generated configuration.nix
nixos-generate-config
cp /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix /mnt/etc/nixos/thonkpad/

# Install this NixOS configuration with flakes
nixos-install --root /mnt --flake /mnt/etc/nixos#thonkpad --impure
```
4. Reboot, login as root, and change the password for your user using `passwd`.
5. Log in as your normal user.
